## About me

@OskarD3v - a student enrolled in medical data science.

Within my different repositories[^1] I will be:
1. following along with my lectures/classes
2. assesing newly aquired skills
3. keeping my projects going with different branches, so I can share them with my fellow students :cowboy_hat_face:

### The Checklist:

- [X] Interested and genuinely amazed at the vast Data Science and Data Analysis field?
- [X] In love with languages and communication?
- [X] Open to learning things from scratch?

...yes,yes,yes aaand yes!
These are my goals and I strive to achieve them :trophy:

Anyone is welcome to comment, help or interest me in new projects and ideas! <br>
I am at anyone's disposal in English, German, Russian, French, Spanish, and hopefully many more in the near future.
